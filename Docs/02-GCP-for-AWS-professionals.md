## Regions and Zones

### AWS

- products are deploreyed within `Regions`
  - devides regions into `Availabiltiy Zones`
- By design, each AWS Region is isolated and independent from other AWS Regions
  - ensures availability of one region doesn't affect the availability of other regions
- AWS POP provides Content Delivery Network, `AWS CloudFront`

### GCP

- service availability is divided into `Regions` and `Zones`
- also located at `Multi-Regional` level rather than more granular `Regional` or `Zonal` level
  - includes `Google App Engine` and `Google Cloud Storage`
  - locations: United States, Europe, and Asia
- Google Cloud Regions are isolated from each other bbut has built-in functionality that enables Regions to synchronize data across Regions according to the needs of a given Google Cloud Service
- GCP POP provides `Google Cloud CDN` and built-in caching for `Google App Engine`, `Google Cloud Storage` and others.

| Concept | AWS | GCP |
| --| -- | -- |
| Cluster of data centeres and services | Region | Region |
| Absracted data center | Availability Zone | Zone |
| Edge caching | POP (CloudFront) | POP (multiple services) |

## Accounts, Limits, Pricing
